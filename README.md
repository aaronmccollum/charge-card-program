# Charge Card Program
Based off the payment cards used in Japan rail transportation, this is a basic charge-card program to simulate adding, paying, and checking the balance of an electronic payment card.

## What I've Learned and Practiced (so far)
- using Ruby arrays to hold acceptable answers to prompts to the user
- using string.include? to see if a user's answer is part of my acceptable answers
- inserting variables directly into Ruby strings with the #{} syntax

## Upcoming Goals for this Project
- create the same program using JavaScript
- create a web-based UI with HTML and CSS to simulate the card screen on a Tokyo terminal
- attach the JavaScript program to the UI using buttons and printing results to the screen
